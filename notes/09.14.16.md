# ForgeHub Work Notes

## Purpose
- Create prototype for Forge's IOS/Android App

## Tasks left to complete for MVP
- Make youtube-esque UI in RN
  - use screen shots from my iPhone 5 as templates to achieve pseudo pixel perfect design while keeping it responsive
  - Complete only UI for representing data on the server, leave user interactions/mutations for later
  - Make app loading screen to match forge's website theme w/ logo
  - add fonts that resemble youtube's fonts, ie. Roboto
- Deploy Backend
  - Either heroku or AWS
  - try to get scrapper deployed also
- Deploy prototype for iPhone 5
  - picked iPhone 5 since I own iPhone 5, and I can base Forgehub's UI on Utube's App on iPhone 5
    - Helps to scaffold the app, and get measurements for views down to the pixel
  - put server on heroku
  - use Appetize.io as mobile emulator for the web
- Bonus Features for MVP
  - Pull to refresh to pull new data from Forge website
    - Only go for this if running selinium web driver is easy to set up on the cloud
- check to see how the UI/UX looks on Iphone 6
  - Do small adjustments to make it look cleaner on both formats if possible
  - this is not a priority for barebones MVP version/Appetize.io prototype
- Build the barebones MVP version to .app format and compress it for publication on Appetize.io, and share with Forge

## Today's Thoughts
- Code Improvements
  - Research js.coach for RN pakages
    - react-native-progress, react-native-image-progress, should be added to app
    - check out other packages under 'indicators' on js.coach
