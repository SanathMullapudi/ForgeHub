# ForgeHub Work Notes

## Purpose
- Create prototype for Forge's IOS/Android App

## Tasks left to complete for MVP
- Deploy Backend
  - Either heroku or AWS
  - try to get scrapper deployed also
- Make youtube-esque UI in RN
  - use screen shots from my iPhone 5 as templates to achieve pseudo pixel perfect design while keeping it responsive
  - Complete only UI for representing data on the server, leave user interactions/mutations for later
  - Make app loading screen to match forge's website theme w/ logo
- Deploy prototype for iPhone 5
  - picked iPhone 5 since I own iPhone 5, and I can base Forgehub's UI on Utube's App on iPhone 5
    - Helps to scaffold the app, and get measurements for views down to the pixel
  - put server on heroku
  - use Appetize.io as mobile emulator for the web
- Bonus Features for MVP
  - Pull to refresh to pull new data from Forge website
    - Only go for this if running selinium web driver is easy to set up on the cloud
- check to see how the UI/UX looks on Iphone 6
  - Do small adjustments to make it look cleaner on both formats if possible
  - this is not a priority for barebones MVP version/Appetize.io prototype
- Build the barebones MVP version and compress it for publication on Appetize.io

## Tasks Completed Today
- Added .jscsrc
  - Added rc file for jscs to help distinguish common maximumLine warnings from cluttering the screen.
  - Added a custom model method on base schema of mongo to avoid repetition of '{new: true, upsert: true}' when using 'findOneAndUpdate'
- Convert backend database/scrapper output from a JSON file to real database
  - Initially start with mongodb, makes for easy prototyping
- Complete Graphql/Mongo backend
  - Ensure Graphql schema originally pulling from json database, now returns proper values from mongo database
  - Delete old js files related to json database

## Today's Thoughts
- Mongo Inheritance?! via Discriminators and ES6, to reduce code/logic duplication
  - the overlap in logic/code between the User and Game models could be solved with new mongoose discriminators
    - http://mongoosejs.com/docs/discriminators.html
  - Do this later for sake of learning but doesn't need to be part of the MVP
- The scraping algorithm restructure (avoid doing this now since, the mock database wouldn't be necessary with actual access to Forge's backend)
  - the algorithm --> Json --> then to mongo is fine for now, but can be refactored to be more extensible, and collate the related code blocks
  - the css selectors in 'options.js' can be moved into the mongo models that they describe,
  - the parsing should skip the json and write straight to mongo, this reducing unnecessary async code/related duplication (like looping through essentially the same structure 2x)
  - a more generalized approach breaks the 'scraper' into 2 phases a seek phase and find phase, like it currently is but be coded to make that more apparent and allow for callback tie in's that work into the main algorithm, similar to specToGraphQL
    - this would allow more modular chucks like, parse item (going either to JSON/Mongo), and allow for better seek phase than 'just look at top 50 videos'
    - could allow for finite page visiting, to correct like a single video
    - could allow better Performance/UI for the pull-to-refresh portion
    - also the helper functions that are essentially reformatting functions would be placed in the mongo model they match
