Completed:
- Complete Graphql/Mongo backend
  - Ensure Graphql schema originally pulling from json database, now returns proper values from mongo database
  - Delete old js files related to json database

Barebones MVP Tasks to complete (ordered):
- Deploy Backend
  - Either heroku or AWS
  - try to get scrapper deployed also
- Make youtube-esque UI in RN
  - use screen shots from my iphone 5 as templates to achieve pseudo pixel perfect design while keeping it responsive
- Deploy prototype
  - put server on heroku
  - use Appetize.io as mobile emulator for the web
- Bonus Features for MVP
  - Pull to refresh to pull new data from Forge website
    - Only go for this if running selinium web driver is easy to set up on the cloud
  - check to see how the UI/UX looks on Iphone 6
    - Do small adjustments to make it look cleaner on both formats if possible
    - this is not a priority for barebones MVP version/Appetize.io prototype

Code Thoughts
- Mongo Inheritance?! via Discriminators and ES6, to reduce code/logic duplication
  - the overlap in logic/code between the User and Game models could be solved with new mongoose discriminators
    - http://mongoosejs.com/docs/discriminators.html
  - Do this later for sake of learning but doesn't need to be part of the MVP

Early Thoughts before merging into notes
- The scraping algorithm restructure (avoid doing this now since, the mock database wouldn't be necessary with actual access to Forge's backend)
  - the algorithm --> Json --> then to mongo is fine for now, but can be refactored to be more extensible, and collate the related code blocks
  - the css selectors in 'options.js' can be moved into the mongo models that they describe,
  - the parsing should skip the json and write straight to mongo, this reducing unnecessary async code/related duplication (like looping through essentially the same structure 2x)
  - a more generalized approach breaks the 'scraper' into 2 phases a seek phase and find phase, like it currently is but be coded to make that more apparent and allow for callback tie in's that work into the main algorithm, similar to specToGraphQL
    - this would allow more modular chucks like, parse item (going either to JSON/Mongo), and allow for better seek phase than 'just look at top 50 videos'
    - could allow for finite page visiting, to correct like a single video
    - could allow better Performance/UI for the pull-to-refresh portion
    - also the helper functions that are essentially reformatting functions would be placed in the mongo model they match
- Added .jscsrc
  - Added rc file for jscs to help distinguish common maximumLine warnings from cluttering the screen.
  - Added a custom model method on base schema of mongo to avoid repetition of '{new: true, upsert: true}' when using 'findOneAndUpdate'
- For Future Tasks Relay Subscriptions?
- Future task implement soundcloud like comments that show based on time stamps

# ForgeHub
- Written 8:25pm, 9/5/2016

## Purpose
  - Create prototype for Forge's IOS/Android App

## Tasks
  - Convert backend database/scrapper output from a JSON file to real database
    - Initially start with mongodb, makes for easy prototyping
  - Generate UI/Views for App
    - Complete only UI for representing data on the server, leave user interactions/mutations for later
    - Make app loading screen to match forge's website theme w/ logo
  - Build the barebones MVP version and compress it for publication on Appetize.io

## Future Fun
  - User interactions
    - User Auth
      - better implementation if auth is baked into graphql implementation via graphql's context parameter w/ JWT token stored client side or alternative implementation to the same effect
    - Social integration (likes, comments, shares, etc.)
    - reactivity (i.e. real time via relay subscriptions or socket cluster or 'fake it' w/ simple web sockets builtin to RN not connected to graphql, but integration with graphql would be a more interesting proposition and better learning experience)
  - Video encoding script (potentially AWS lambda) that fires when uploading to s3 bucket, and encodes the video for various common video formats
    - use AWS Elastic Transcoder or zencoder's offered solution
  - Tie in a little machine learning fun w/ 'fake data'  that shows how to pick related video section etc.
    - Also could be interesting to do A/B testing on slightly different UI's and record various stats (time spend on app, on video, etc.) to find optional UI/UX that way
  - UI/UX improvements
  - Security/ExtraValidations/'Housekeeping'
  - Performance Tuning
    - Common pitfalls --> Common optimizations --> Testing --> Profiling --> Testing --> Profiling .... --> Eventually Done
    - Moving down to Native when necessary

### Misc Tasks
  - Write/Blog about experience

### Complete
  - Update existing tools (Node, xCode, etc.)
    - Node, Xcode, and other npm modules are all updated to latest versions that do not conflict with each other
  - Search for any new tools/updates to old tools for React Native since I last checked
    - Siphon
      - Exponent like ease of pushing prototypes to devices through their app
        - Unfortunately this leads to their downfall as they like Exponent, don't offer a way to push custom native modules to prototypes, and they realized this and have decided to terminate their endeavors
      - 'pain-free publishing for react native', essentially minimizing the grunt work to deploy to IOS/Android
      - CodePush/AppHub style 'pushing updates to production apps'
    - Ignite
      - Essentially the same as it was when I previously looked at it
      - Skeleton Generator, with an emphasis on Redux
    - Deco
      - Hasn't published much progress since I last checked but should the majority of popular custom native modules be added to deco, with better tooling (fails to recognize 'View/components' that were not dragged from their list, as components with properties), and less bugs in the IDE, and it could super popular among designers and may legs up from 'constraint builder' that IOS offers in the form of AutoLayout
    - FastLane
      - Looks amazing from the demo/intro video https://fastlane.tools/
      - Essentially a CI tool like travis for mobile development supporting react native
      - Offers a ton of time saving features (automatic screenshots and signing certificates!!!, etc.) and integrations (slack, etc.) that make it worthwhile for a large/serious project
    - Nuclide
      - Hasn't changed much from last time, a basic IDE for JS development, with support for Debugger/Element Inspector for RN
      - Does have an issue with Node 6.x where the debugger fails to connect with the simulator, but you can fix by running Node 5.x or targeting 5.x through Nuclide settings
    - Misc.
      - Lots of other platforms have lent their hand of approval for React Native, either via promises to add react native support to their platform (Ubuntu, Microsoft, Samsung, etc...) or tooling (Visual Studio Code)
      - Fable is alternative to extent for allowing React Native to be written in F#
      - Facebook's Paper-Like UI has been done with Native, and some crazy people are even trying some openGl integration
        - Reference links
      - RN 0.32 allows for more components (SwipeableListView, cross platform ActivityIndicator, KeyboardAvoidingView) and some new css stuff (StyleSheet.absoluteFill, layout algorithm, better flexbox implementation, starting to offloading Animations from the JS tread, z-index)
  - Find/Learn the basic of a popular Web Automation/Test Framework
    - Learned the basic of Selenium and built scrapper to fetch necessary data from Forge's Website
  - Setup BoilerPlate for React Native and Graphql Backend Server, Relay, Babel etc.
